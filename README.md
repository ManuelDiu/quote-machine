# Random Quote Machine (React + SASS)

This is my Random Quote Machine project, for the FreeCodeCamp's front end library certification.

I used the same [url](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/camperbot/5a022b72e96c4c9585c32bf6a75f62d9/raw/e3c6895ce42069f0ee7e991229064f167fe8ccdc/quotes.json) FreeCodeCamp used in their project, to FETCH quotes & authors (JSON format).
